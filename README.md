## SIVEP COVID-19 Brazil app

Along with this correspondence, we developed a R shiny app to monitor COVID-19 hospital admissions from the SIVEP-Gripe database.

Access: [SIVEP COVID-19 Brazil](https://lslbastos.shinyapps.io/sivep_covid_brazil/)

The app is updated regularly with the release of new data using Github Actions (Currently, ~~every Wednsday, 19:00 GMT-3~~ updates have stopped due to changes in data source).
Data used in the app can be found in this repository at  `input/app_data`.
